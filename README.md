A Google Now-style feed for Android by Charlyn Buchanan, Rosmary Fermin, and Jaellys Bales.

Access Code 2.1, [Coalition for Queens](http://www.c4q.nyc/)

[Project Requirements](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-2/blob/master/project/requirements.md)

## Submission Notes
* We are working on merging the project into master in its current state.
* A Maps API key and Direction API key is required to successfully use the Maps card. You can generate these keys in the Google Dev Console, or you can message me (Jae) for mine -- I allowed other IPs and apps to make requests with them.
* You'll enter the Maps/Direction keys in strings.xml (line 9 "jb_maps_key", line 13 "jb_directions_key").
* Still working on this for final demo.
